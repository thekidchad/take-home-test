# LegalPlace Take-Home Test Specification

I'm a new developer and I want to join your team. 
So here my small contribution to make your project awesome.
I made the decision to first refactor in TypeScript, this choice was motivated by my ability to go fast into refactor. Otherwise with some delay, we would need to respect the existing code in order not to increase the delay.


## How to build the project

Docker is a great choice to harmonize configuration (node/npm/yarn version), make sure you have Docker installed 

```docker -v``` if it returns something its good :) 

#### Build

```docker build -t take-home-test .```


#### Run

```docker run take-home-test``` 

#### Run with docker-compose
